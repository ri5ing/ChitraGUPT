/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for ChitraGupt Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset employs a strict, path-based ownership model combined with role-based access for auditor profiles.
 * Users can only access their own data, while auditor profiles are publicly readable but writable only by the auditor themselves or an admin.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore data is structured hierarchically with user profiles and contracts nested under `/users/{userId}`.
 * Auditor profiles are stored in the top-level `/auditors/{auditorId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Auditor profiles are publicly readable to support the "Recommend Auditor" feature.
 * - Ownership is enforced at each level of the hierarchy using path-based rules.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  N/A - In this iteration, we're focusing on strict ownership via path-based rules.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  Public auditor profiles are stored separately from private user data.
